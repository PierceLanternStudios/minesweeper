  **Description:**
  
This project is a React/TS based app for the classic game, Minesweeper! 
This was created as a personal project to work on React skills and state
management. Additionally, I used this game as an opportunity to create 
custom artwork and assets, and implement them into a game of my own 
design. There was an additional heavy focus on QoL features in the game,
including things like auto-fill tiles, seed sharing, and progress saving. 
I'm really happy with how the game came out! It was a really fun project
and I enjoyed working on it. 

  **How to Play:**
  
The game is hosted live at:

https://piercelanternstudios.github.io/minesweeper/

Once there, configure the game settings and press start! The game is 
designed to replicate classic minesweeper, with a few notable QoL 
improvements (including one that prevents "50-50s", a classic problem
with original minesweeper. 

  **Future Work:**
  
There are a few minor QoL additions that I would like to add in the future.
I would like to add a way to play the game entirely from keyboard, using 
arrow keys/WASD to move and select tiles. This will require some reworking
of the way tiles are stored and rendered in the game logic, but it shouldn't 
be too bad. Additionally, while not a part of traditional minesweeper, I 
would like to add a safeguard that prevents players from losing the game on
their first move, to make the game more approachable.
